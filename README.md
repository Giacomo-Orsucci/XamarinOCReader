# XamarinOCReader
Microsoft Xamarin app that can read photos of texts using OCR Microsoft Azure services

This is the first app that I developed using Xamarin and C#. The app was created to launch my first start-up during my last high-school year.
This app was part of a large school project and it's half functioning.

The app can be fully deployed only on Androids (However the IOS code is still in the folders. I recommend Android 10) and to use it, 
it's necessary to subscribe Microsoft Azure computer vision (OCR) services and add the requested credentials in the project file named "Ocr.cs".

This app can be used only with smartphone camera and, after taking a picture of a text, it reads to you that text.

The original project originally included the possibility of using it with a special electronic pen developed by BlindTechJA, my first start up.
BlindTechJA had the goal to improve the life of blind and visually impaired people. 

Anyway, during the creation of the app I really struggled to find something usefull to the developement and the usage of the OCR services
for mobile. So, it's my intention to share completely free this code hoping to be valuable to someone and, why not, some important projects.

The app can read all the languages supported by the Microsoft OCR services, but hand-written languages are not still well supported.
Instead, the vocal instruction written by me to help blind users are only in Italian.

Enjoy! I hope you'll find the code well-written and the project interesting!

If you need help or you only want to know something more about me or the code, contact me!
